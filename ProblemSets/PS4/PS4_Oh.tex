\section*{Q7.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Data source, I want to scrap
    \item[] I am interested in the secondary market of Sneakers which is mainly on GOAT, StockX, and Ebay. In my guess, even though it is the fact that there are three big platforms for selling the sneakers, people who want to buy and sell sneakers are willing to enroll their bid and ask price on all the website they can because it helps them to catch as many opportunities as possible. Therefore, I assume - it looks strict -- StockX can represent the secondary market of sneakers. Since StockX\footnote{url{https://stockx.com}} has API for their sale-history, I eager to scrap their data with their permission - only approved developers can get the API.\footnote{url{https://developer.stockx.com}}
    \item For \textbf{Q.5 (d)}
    \item[] the type of an object \textit{mydf\$date} is a ``Character''.
